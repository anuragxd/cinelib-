```

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **User creates playlist** → Enters name/description
2. **Searches movies** → TMDB API returns results
3. **Selects movies** → Adds to local state
4. **Submits form** → Creates playlist in database
5. **Adds movies** → Links movies to playlist
6. **Redirects** → Shows completed playlist

## 🔧 Technical Details

- **API**: TMDB v3 REST API
- **Images**: Served from TMDB CDN
- **Caching**: Browser caches movie posters
- **Fallbacks**: Placeholder images if posters fail
- **Rate Limits**: 40 requests/10 seconds (plenty for dev)
